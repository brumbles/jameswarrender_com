This is the Bewitching Tale of Malleus Froom â€“ a feared and notorious witch hunter from the sixteenth century.

When young Martha Jennings is taken by three hooded figures in the woods by her home in the village of Auldkeep, the villagers quickly suspect witchcraft. The Mayor, Thomas Crandle calls in their one hope, their only hope, Malleus Froom.

Froom arrives and begins his investigation and with the help of the villagers he soon realises that evil resides in Auldkeep.

But is all as it seems?
