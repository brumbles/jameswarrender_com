In 1612 Rebecca Anson travels on the Aurora II to start a new life in Amberguard, Virginia. By 1616 she is hanged for practicing witchcraft. 

Over the following years the Townsfolk are plagued by death and hauntings by a ghostly lady in red. The town is eventually abandoned after a fire and over one hundred years later is rediscovered and redeveloped; soon after the hauntings return. 

This novel explores the deepest, darkest events that lead to Rebecca Anson’s execution and follows the blood that is spilled afterwards. If you didn’t already, you soon will Fear Rebecca Anson.
