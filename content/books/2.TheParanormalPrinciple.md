What makes us believe in ghosts? What makes us skeptical of a life after death? These are the questions that paranormal investigator James Warrender endeavours to answer in this new volume.

Looking at both sides of the argument, Warrender strives to investigate the beliefes of both sides of the spiritual argument.

In this volume and for the very first time, James talks about some of his own paranormal investigation.
