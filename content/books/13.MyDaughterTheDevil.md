"So this is your thirteenth book. You know you have to do something really special this time. You can't do one of the detective stories or a haunted house one, you have to go all out and really scare folk." 

"Maybe 13 short stories all linked in some way. I mean really, really scary." 

Okay Grunny, here you go - 13 short, scary and terrifying stories all for you... and yes they are all linked in some way!
